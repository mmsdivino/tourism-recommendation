Thanks to the Semantic Web technological stack and to the more recent Linked Open Data (LOD) initiative, a vast amount of RDF data have been published in freely accessible datasets connected with each other to form the so called LOD cloud. As of today, we have tons of RDF data available in the Web of Data, but only a few applications really exploit their potential power. The availability of such data is for sure an opportunity to feed personalized information access tools such as recommender systems. We present an overview on recommender systems and we sketch how to use Linked Open Data to build a new generation of semantics-aware recommendation engines.},

    abstract = {Recommender systems are now popular both commercially and in the research community, where many approaches have been suggested for providing recommendations. In many cases a system designer that wishes to employ a recommendation system must choose between a set of candidate approaches.  A first step towards selecting an appropriate algorithm is to decide which properties of the application to focus upon when making this choice.  Indeed, recommendation systems have a variety of properties that may affect user experience, such as accuracy, robustness, scalability, and so forth. In this paper we discuss how to compare recommenders based on a set of properties that are relevant for e application. We focus on comparative studies, where a few algorithms are compared using some evaluation metric, rather than absolute benchmarking of algorithms. We describe experimental settings appropriate for making choices between algorithms.  We review three types of experiments, starting with an offline setting, where recommendation approaches are compared without user interaction, then reviewing user studies, where a small group of subjects experiment with the system and report on the experience, and finally describe large scale online experiments, where real user populations interact with the system. In each of these cases we describe types of questions that can be answered, and suggest protocols for experimentation. We also discuss how to draw trustworthy conclusions from e conducted experiments. We then review a large set of properties, and explain how to evaluate systems given relevant properties. We also survey a large set of evaluation metrics in the context of the property that they evaluate.},

They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

Content-based recommendation systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. Indeed, the basic process performed by a content-based recommender consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item), in order to recommend to the user new interesting items. This chapter provides an overview of content-based recommender systems, with the aim of imposing a degree of order on the diversity of the different aspects involved in their design and implementation. The first part of the chapter presents the basic concepts and terminology of contentbased recommender systems, a high level architecture, and their main advantages and drawbacks. The second part of the chapter provides a review of the state of the art of systems adopted in several application domains, by thoroughly describing both classical and advanced techniques for representing items and user profiles. The most widely adopted techniques for learning user profiles are also presented. The last part of the chapter discusses trends and future research which might lead towards the next generation of systems, by describing the role of User Generated Content as a way for taking into account evolving vocabularies, and the challenge of feeding users with serendipitous recommendations, that is to say surprisingly interesting items that they might not have otherwise discovered.},

  comment = {Collaborative filtering is inefficient for: early rater problem, sparsity problem, gray sheep.
	A content-based filter analyzes items rated by an individual user
	and uses the content of the items as well as the provided ratings
	to build a profile to compare to other non-rated items to recommend
	additional items of interest.
	
	By using a combination of content-based and collaborative filters
	we can realize the benefits of content-based filters which include
	early predictions that cover all items and users, while gaining the
	benefits of accurate collaborative filtering predictions as the number
	of users and ratings increases,.
	
	We provide a unique approach to combining content-based and collaborative
	filtering by basing a prediction on a weighted average of the content-based
	prediction and the collaborative prediction. In addition, our approach
	allows for the content-based and collaborative weights to be computed
	on a per-item basis. The weights are adjusted based on the strength
	of each prediction. As the number of users and ratings for the item
	increase, the collaborative filter is (usually) weighted more heaviy,
	increasing the overall accuracy of the prediction.
	
	Our approach is not a hybrid approach, meaning that the basis for
	the content-based and collaborative predictions are kept separate.
	This allows us to benefit from individual advances made to either
	collaborative or content-based filters since there is no inter-dependency
	between the two content components. For example, individual improvements
	to pure collaborative filtering algorithms can be fully realized.
	
	We build upon the work of the pure collaborative filtering algorithms
	published that compute similarities between users usaing a Pearson
	correlation coefficient [4, 21, 9].
	
	Our content-based filtering algorithms match article keywords to keywords
	in the user profile (we use the overlap coefficient). Predicitions
	from the three interest indicators, explicit keywords, implicit keywords
	and newspaper section, are combined via matching functions with the
	article keywords and section. Until we determine appropriate weights
	for each content-match through extensive user studies, we give each
	an equal weight of \$1/3\$.
	
	Vogt et al showed that a simple linear combination of scores returned
	by different Information Retrieval agents can improve the performance
	of those individual systems on new documents [23]. We build upon
	their work by combining our collaborative filtering prediction with
	our content-based prediction using a weighted average. 
	
	The trick is to come up with the weights that result in the most accurate
	prediction. The collaborative filtering predictions are more inaccurate
	in cases where the number, agreement or history between users is
	low [12]. We start by giving equal weight to both the collaborative
	filtering and the content-based scores for all the users. As users
	make ratings, we compute the absolute error from the content-based
	predictions and the collaborative predictions and adjust the weights
	so as to minimize past error. (it learns as the time passes)
	
	In order to evaluate the filtering performance of P-Tango we computed
	the mean absolute error between the numerical predictions provided
	by P-Tango and the numerical ratings entered by the user for the
	same articles.},

	abstract = {The rapid urban expansion has greatly extended the physical boundary of users' living area and developed a large number of POIs (points of interest). POI recommendation is a task that facilitates users' urban exploration and helps them filter uninteresting POIs for decision making. While existing work of POI recommendation on location-based social networks (LBSNs) discovers the spatial, temporal, and social patterns of user check-in behavior, the use of content information has not been systematically studied. The various types of content information available on LBSNs could be related to different aspects of a user's check-in action, providing a unique opportunity for POI recommendation. In this work, we study the content information on LBSNs w.r.t. POI properties, user interests, and sentiment indications. We model the three types of information under a unified POI recommendation framework with the consideration of their relationship to check-in actions. The experimental results exhibit the significance of content information in explaining user behavior, and demonstrate its power to improve POI recommendation performance on LBSNs.},

    abstract="Mobile tourist guides have attracted considerable research interest during the past decade, resulting in numerous standalone and web-based mobile applications. Particular emphasis has been given to personalization of services, typically based on travel recommender systems used to assist tourists in choosing places to visit; these systems address an important aspect of personalization and hence reduce the information burden for the user. However, existing systems fail to exploit information, behaviours, evaluations or ratings of other tourists with similar interests, which would potentially provide ground for the cooperative production of improved tourist content and travel recommendations. In this paper, we extend this notion of travel recommender systems utilizing collaborative filtering techniques while also taking into account contextual information (such as the current user's location, time, weather conditions and places already visited by the user) for deriving improved recommendations in pervasive environments. We also propose the use of wireless sensor network (WSN) installations around tourist sites for enabling precise localization and also providing mobile users convenient and inexpensive means for uploading tourist information and ratings about points of interest (POI) via their mobile devices. We also introduce the concept of `context-aware rating', whereby user ratings uploaded through WSN infrastructures are weighted higher to differentiate among users that rate POIs using the mobile tourist guide application while onsite and others using the Internet away from the POI.",

    abstract="In order to generate relevant recommendations, a context-aware recommender system (CARS) not only makes use of user preferences, but also exploits information about the specific contextual situation in which the recommended item will be consumed. For instance, when recommending a holiday destination, a CARS could take into account whether the trip will happen in summer or winter. It is unclear, however, which contextual factors are important and to which degree they influence user ratings. A large amount of data and complex context-aware predictive models must be exploited to understand these relationships. In this paper, we take a new approach for assessing and modeling the relationship between contextual factors and item ratings. Rather than using the traditional approach to data collection, where recommendations are rated with respect to real situations as participants go about their lives as normal, we simulate contextual situations to more easily capture data regarding how the context influences user ratings. To this end, we have designed a methodology whereby users are asked to judge whether a contextual factor (e.g., season) influences the rating given a certain contextual condition (e.g., season is summer). Based on the analyses of these data, we built a context-aware mobile recommender system that utilizes the contextual factors shown to be important. In a subsequent user evaluation, this system was preferred to a similar variant that did not exploit contextual information.",
